## THE METALLICA BLACKLIST (2021)

The idea for *The Metallica Blacklist* came from Metallica management's "Chief Creative Guy" [Marc Reiter](https://www.metallica.com/so-what/2021-07-01-marc-reiter-metallica-blacklist.html), who was thinking about how to expand Metallica's reach beyond simply remastering their 1991 tapes. The band was all in. Metallica themselves selected some of the contributing artists—which ones, I never leaned, though I suspect they had a hand in inviting [Ghost](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GsXTfdPOL7A), [St. Vincent](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/st-vincent-kirk-hammett-metallica-musicians-on-musicians-901764/), and [The Hu](https://twitter.com/Metallica/status/1336000294887378944)—while other contributors were new names to the band, and even [new to the band's discography](https://www.metallica.com/so-what/2021-08-03-tomi-owo-sw-interview.html) themselves.

One of the biggest critiques of the Blacklist was its imbalance. Metallica allowed artists to choose which song on The Black Album they would cover, so naturally artists whose primarily fanbase weren't metalheads would choose Metallica's most recognized song. (But really, Ghost? You couldn't have gone for a deeper cut?) Every song on the Black Album received its dues eventually—but it was a close call. "Of Wolf and Man" and "The Struggle Within" received only one cover each, while their power ballad "Nothing Else Matters" is the most overrepresented song on the record by a long shot.
