## METALLICA (1991)

When a band releases a self-titled album, it's a manifesto, a declaration of "This is who we are." Some bands debut with their opus eponymous. Others drop it midway through their discography, a pivot point, a clean slate to announce their new identity going forward. Metallica is an example of the latter. 

By 1991, Metallica had toured internationally, won a Grammy, founded an entire metal subgenre through an iconic four-album run that only got more vicious and virtuosic. If they stopped there, the thrash kings could have lived the rest of their lives on royalties alone. But they didn't. After concluding their tour for *...And Justice For All,* (people got bored - find that quote where someone says they never want to play ...Justice ever again). Metallica hit the studio for their fifth album
