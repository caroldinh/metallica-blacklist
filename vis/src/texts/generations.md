## OPEN MIND FOR A DIFFERENT VIEW

The Black Album marked a shift not only in what Metallica’s music sounded like, but also in what their fans looked like. Jason Newsted explains it in a [1992 interview with MTV](https://youtu.be/DRpny40pr8E?si=WzKqVRoivwTItuen&t=2224): "It used to be just like, white guys from twelve to twenty and whatever, now... you see a lot more girls, you see, say, a father who’s thirty years old and he has a son with him that’s six or seven." Kirk added, "In Manchester, I saw an old couple up front at the rail. It was amazing! This person had to be at least forty-five or fifty."

Metallica are in their sixties now, parents of Generation Z, and no one today would bat an eye at a middle-aged parent bringing their kid to the snakepit. And for Millennial and Gen Z fans, it is not uncommon to have grown up with Metallica. Indeed, **Millennials are the most well-represented generation** of the artists on *The Metallica Blacklist.* If the band as an entity were human, it, too would be a Millennial: founded in 1981, Metallica was most prolific from *Kill 'Em All* (1983) to *Reload* (1997), mapping perfectly onto Millennials' birth years.  

Furthermore, **15 of 53 songs on the Blacklist feature female vocalists** (with two instrumental songs featuring no vocals). [Female artists tend to draw female listeners](https://everynoise.com/gender_tldr.html); likewise, younger faces on stage usually mean younger faces in the crowd. It's hard to quantify the demographics of an artist's fanbase—even Metallica doesn't have a [census à la the BTS Army](https://web.archive.org/web/20231201174820/https://www.btsarmycensus.com/2022-results)—but EveryNoise.com (RIP!) at least tracks the age and gender distribution of music genres. Here's how the Blacklist stacks up.
