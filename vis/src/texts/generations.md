## OPEN MIND FOR A DIFFERENT VIEW

The Black Album marked a shift not only in what Metallica’s music sounded like, but also in what their fans looked like. Jason Newsted explains it in a 1992 interview with MTV: "It used to be just like, white guys from twelve to twenty and whatever, now... you see a lot more girls, you see, say, a father who’s thirty years old and he has a son with him that’s six or seven." Kirk added, "In Manchester, I saw an old couple up front at the rail. It was amazing! This person had to be at least forty-five or fifty."

Metallica are in their sixties now, parents of Generation Z, and no one today would bat an eye at a middle-aged parent bringing their kid to the snakepit. And for Millennial and Gen Z fans, it is not uncommon to have grown up with Metallica. Indeed, Millennials are the most well-represented generation of the artists on *The Metallica Blacklist.* If the band as an entity were human, it, too would be a Millennial: founded in 1981, Metallica was most prolific from *Kill 'Em All* (1983) to *Reload* (1997), mapping perfectly onto Millennials' birth years.

Most notable about *The Metallica Blacklist* is the breadth of genres represented on the album.

Younger faces on stage usually mean younger faces in the crowd. It's hard to quantify the demographics of an artist's fanbase—even Metallica doesn't have a census a la BTS—but EveryNoise at least tracks the age and gender distribution of music genres. Here's how the Blacklist stacks up.
