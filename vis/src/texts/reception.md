## NEVER CARED FOR WHAT THEY SAY

*The Metallica Blacklist* is a study in what makes a good cover—a question that is highly individual and subjective, but perhaps one that professional reviews of the compilation can help us answer. I parsed through ten reviews to see how critics articulated what worked and what didn’t, arriving on the following categories:


* **PROFICIENCY:** 
* **COMPOSITION:** Did a structural element of the cover stand out?
* **INTERPRETATION:** Emotion
* **INSTRUMENTATION**
* **REPUTATION:**
* **GENRE:** 
* **LOYALTY:** 
* **MEMORABILITY:** Did this particular cover stand out (especially amongst others of the same song?)

For each mention of any cover in a review, I appended a score—+1 for a positive or neutral mention, -1 for a negative mention—to see what aspects of a cover were most praised or most criticized.


* Some aspects that were criticized in some covers were praised in others: White Reaper receives kudos for their loyalty to “Sad But True,” but Weezer gets a universal eyeroll for their cookie-cutter “Enter Sandman.”


Unsurprisingly, Miley Cyrus's *Nothing Else Matters* receives more attention than the rest, thanks to its high-profile byline. But I was disappointed that one of my favorite songs, Imelda May's "The God that Failed," went unnoticed by popular outlets. Which is the better cover? I'll let you decide for yourself.
