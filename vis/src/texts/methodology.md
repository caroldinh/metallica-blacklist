### METHODOLOGY

This project was developed primarily with React.js and AnyChart.js. I used Flourish, a no-code visualization builder, for the world map. All of my code (including the Jupyter notebooks and Excel charts that I used to scrape and process my data) can be found in [this repository](https://github.com/caroldinh/metallica-blacklist).  

Audio analyses (speechiness, danceability, etc.), artist metadata (name, genres, profile picture), and song previews were retrieved from the Spotify API in May 2024. Demographics of Spotify listeners sorted by genre were scraped from EveryNoise (as [archived in December 2023](https://web.archive.org/web/20231207012321/https://everynoise.com/everynoise1d.cgi?vector=femininity&scope=all)). Data on artists' nationality and generation were hand-gathered from Google and Wikipedia searches.

Review quotes were selected from all online-accessible critical reviews of *The Metallica Blacklist* listed on [MetaCritic](https://www.metacritic.com/music/the-metallica-blacklist/various-artists), and then categorized by my subjective judgment.
