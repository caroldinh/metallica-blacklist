When I first started college, everyone and their mother seemed to be putting out a Metallica cover. From those I followed on Spotify: St. Vincent, Cage the Elephant, Royal Blood. The first two or three I shrugged off as a funny coincidence. A couple more and I began to figure something was up. 

It was September 2021, thirty years after the release of Metallica's eponymous "Black Album," and that fall I sat down to listen to the band's first release since I started listening to them: *The Metallica Blacklist,* a compilation of fifty-three covers to commemorate the anniversary of the album that launched metal into the mainstream.
