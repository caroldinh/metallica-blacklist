So, I mentioned at the beginning that I've only been a Metallica megafan for a couple of years. 

I've at least been familiar with the Black Album since high school. But I think I can pinpoint the exact moment when Metallica lured me into the snakepit once and for all: in 2022, *Stranger Things* Season 4 released on Netflix, and though I never watched the series, I came across their Instagram post months later showing James Hetfield decked out as Eddie Munson for Halloween.    

At this point I'd been into Queen, Nirvana, Guns N' Roses, Van Halen. I knew the snobbery with which some die-hard fans spoke of people my age who liked rock music: everyone's wearing a Nirvana shirt nowadays. Did you know the smiley is a band, not a brand? Can you name three songs? It doesn't count if it's from a movie. The same thing had been happening to Metallica for years, recently resurging with Eddie Munson's upside-down solo. The band was having none of it.  

In response to a TikTok comment bemoaning Metallica's new "Stranger Things fake fans," the band clapped back: "FYI – EVERYONE is welcome in the Metallica Family. Whether you’ve been a fan for 40 hours or 40 years, we all share a bond through music. All of you started at ground zero at one point in time."

"You know what?" I said. "Respect. I should listen to more Metallica."   

I put on *Master of Puppets* and never looked back.
