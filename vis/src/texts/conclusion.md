## ALL THESE WORDS I DON’T JUST SAY

From fans, *The Metallica Blacklist* met mixed reviews. The consensus was that no one, regardless of age, would have known every artist: one Redditor claimed to have only heard of Miley Cyrus; another claimed to recognize half and half. Most could recognize just a handful. Whether that handful consists of Ghost, Volbeat, and Royal Blood—or St. Vincent, Rina Sawayama, and Phoebe Bridgers—depends entirely on who you are and what your non-Metallica music taste is.   

I'd like to believe that this album was not just a means of exposing new listeners to Metallica, but of exposing Metallica listeners to new music. Although I don't love every song, what I love about the *Blacklist* is that most listeners will find both a familiar face and a new artist to pay attention to.   

In any case, it wasn't even *The Metallica Blacklist* that lured me into the snakepit once and for all. No, it was October 2022, and I was in the right place at the right time when James Hetfield posted a Halloween picture of himself dressed as Eddie Munson from *Stranger Things.* Season 4 had come out that summer, introducing a spunky new character who shredded *Master of Puppets* in an epic showdown in the Upside-Down.

I never watched that season, but I'd vaguely been following the band's response to gatekeepers making fun of the new fans my age. "FYI – EVERYONE is welcome in the Metallica Family," the band posted to TikTok, "Whether you’ve been a fan for 40 hours or 40 years, we all share a bond through music. All of you started at ground zero at one point in time."

"You know what?" I said. "Respect. I should listen to more Metallica."

I put on *Master of Puppets* and never looked back.
