## CAME TO BE, HOW IT BEGUN

The idea for *The Metallica Blacklist* came from Metallica management's "Chief Creative Guy" [Marc Reiter](https://www.metallica.com/so-what/2021-07-01-marc-reiter-metallica-blacklist.html), who was thinking about how to expand Metallica's reach beyond simply remastering their 1991 tapes. The band was all in. Metallica themselves selected some of the contributing artists; which ones, I never leaned, though I suspect they had a hand in inviting [Ghost](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GsXTfdPOL7A), [St. Vincent](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/st-vincent-kirk-hammett-metallica-musicians-on-musicians-901764/), and [The Hu](https://twitter.com/Metallica/status/1336000294887378944). Other contributors were new names to the band, and even [new to the band's discography](https://www.metallica.com/so-what/2021-08-03-tomi-owo-sw-interview.html) themselves.

Metallica allowed artists to choose which song on The Black Album they would cover. This means a massive frontload of “Enter Sandman”: naturally artists whose primarily fanbase weren't metalheads would choose Metallica's most recognized song. (But really, Ghost? You couldn't have gone for a deeper cut?) Every song on the Black Album received its dues eventually—but it was a close call. "Of Wolf and Man" and "The Struggle Within" received only one cover each, while their power ballad "Nothing Else Matters" is the most overrepresented song by far, with twelve covers.  

For a taste of each cover, explore the charts below. Spotify provides an [analysis](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/get-audio-features) of each song using variables they've determined as **danceability**, **energy**, **speechiness**, **acousticness**, **instrumentalness**, **liveness**, and **valence**; here we can see how much each cover differs from the original, and from each other.
