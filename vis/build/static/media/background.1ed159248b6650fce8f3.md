When a band releases a self-titled album, it's a manifesto, a declaration of "This is who we are." Some bands debut with their opus eponymous. Others drop it midway through their discography, a pivot point, a clean slate to announce their new identity going forward. ***Metallica* (1991)** is an example of the latter.


When Metallica took over the eighties, it seemed that each new release would get brainier and brainier. Their debut, *Kill ‘Em All,* was the raucous capstone of their scrappy teenage years; *Ride the Lightning* and *Master of Puppets* introduced more complex instrumentals and classical influences. By their 1988 release *…And Justice For All,* they had ventured into prog with a ten-minute title track and riffs in 7/4 time.


Fresh on the metal scene, Metallica were hungry to prove themselves, but their crowds were less receptive. Noticing the “long faces” during one performance of “…And Justice For All,” the band eventually decided, “That’s the last time we ever play that fucking song!”


For their next album, Metallica pivoted. They slowed down their breakneck speeds to stomping pace, recording in a spacious, wood-paneled studio that emulated the acoustics of playing live. It was an album written to rock your socks off to in a stadium, and boy did it live up to its intent. *Metallica*, colloquially known as “The Black Album,” brought the band’s already-Grammy-nominated status from breakthrough Bay Area metalheads to radio-smashing, arena-selling American rock staple. Its opening track “Enter Sandman” still closes out Metallica shows as the band’s biggest hit to this day.
