## NEW BLOOD JOINS THIS EARTH



The Black Album marked a shift not only in what Metallica’s music sounded like, but also in what their fans looked like. 
In 1991, with an average age of twenty-seven, the boys of Metallica were surprised to see parents and middle-agers among their headbanging audience. But come to a show now and this age range is the norm.

The Blacklist, however, is heavy with Millennials: those born between 1981 and 1996. If Metallica was a person, it too would be a millennial—the band was founded in 1981. During this time span, Metallica released an album on average every two to three years. The Black Album came out when the first Millennials were turning ten.

Millennial babies grew up in the aftermath of Metallica's ascent: rather than from underground clubs and snail mail tape trades, they discovered Metallica through MTV, rock radio, their older siblings' disc collections, video games like Guitar Hero. Some of Metallica's most iconic albums are their age.

Most notable about *The Metallica Blacklist* is the breadth of genres represented on the album.

Younger faces on stage usually mean younger faces in the crowd. It's hard to quantify the demographics of an artist's fanbase—even Metallica doesn't have a census a la BTS—but EveryNoise at least tracks the age and gender distribution of music genres. Here's how the Blacklist stacks up.
