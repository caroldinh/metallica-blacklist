The Metallica Blacklist came out in my freshman year of college, thirty years after the release of their 1991 eponymous album. I wouldn’t become obsessed with the band until about a year later—my listening palette wasn’t yet accustomed to their heaviness, and their average track lengths of six minutes or more. But at the time, I liked enough of their greatest hits to give it a listen.
