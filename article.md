The Metallica Blacklist came out in my freshman year of college, thirty years after the release of their 1991 eponymous album. I wouldn’t become obsessed with the band until about a year later—my listening palette wasn’t yet accustomed to their heaviness, and their average track lengths of six minutes or more. But at the time, I liked enough of their greatest hits to give it a listen.

# Life Is Ours, We Live It Our Way
Metallica allowed artists to choose which song they'd like to cover.... meaning a zillion Nothing Else Matters. Section about coverage for each song and differences between each version & the original (according to spotify stats)

# Open Mind For A Different View
section about genre diversity

# And The Earth Becomes My Throne
Or: Who are you? Where ya been? Where ya from?
section about geographic diversity
using Chloropleth map


# New Blood Joins This Earth
Metallica themselves were born between 1962 and 1964, making them Boomers on the brink of Gen X---the Blacklist, however, is heavy with Millennials. The following year, Eddie Munson would shred *Master of Puppets* on the Netflix show *Stranger Things,* making Metallica a hit with my own generation. I recognize many of the artists on Metallica's Blacklist as beloved by Generation Z: Phoebe Bridgers, Rina Sawayama, Cage the Elephant, St. Vincent. Also Metallica's kids are Gen Z haha!
