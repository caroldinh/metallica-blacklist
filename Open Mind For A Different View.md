I was eighteen when *The Metallica Blacklist* graced my Spotify home page. It was Metallica's first release since I started getting into their music, and although I wouldn't become fully obsessed with the band for another year, I enjoyed them enough to give it a listen. 

Like most fans, I didn't sit through the entire record---I just picked out the covers by names I recognized: St. Vincent, Cage the Elephant, Phoebe Bridgers, Rina Sawayama. I felt *seen* by these covers, as if Metallica themselves had written me an invitation to their fanbase: open arms for the posers guilty of the simple crime of being a teenage girl. 

Three years later, fueled by a renewed obsession with the band, I sat down to listen song by song.

# Introduction

In September  1991, Metallica released their eponymous fifth album, debuting some of their most popular songs to this day. *Metallica* was a turning point in the band's discography: after venturing into proto-prog with their previous album *...And Justice For All,* the band resolved to simplify their songwriting for the next record

When a band releases a self-titled album, it could be a way to get their name out there: as a debut record, a declaration of "this is who we are." Or it could indicate a turning point in their discography: this is who we are *now.* For Metallica, it was the latter case. They had already founded an entire genre, proved their virtuosity, built a vicious reputation and earned enough riches to make them set for life.

In 1991, with an average age of twenty-seven, the boys of Metallica were surprised to see parents and middle-agers among their headbanging audience. But come to a show now and this age range is the norm. Metallica themselves were born between 1962 and 1964, making them just barely Boomers. Like many musicians, they were a few years older than their audience---their earliest fans, who Lars Ulrich referred to as "the kids," were primarily Generation X.

The Blacklist, however, is heavy with Millennials. These musicians would have been born after Metallica started their career, the cutoff for their generation being the exact year Metallica was formed. In 2022, Eddie Munson shredded *Master of Puppets* on the Netflix show *Stranger Things,* making Metallica a hit with my own generation (and that of Metallica's kids)---Gen Z.

Millennials, born between 1981 and 1996, dominate the Blacklist. If Metallica was a person, it too would be a millennial---the band was founded in 1981. During this time span, Metallica released an album on average every two to three years. The eighties were especially prolific: while in their late teens and early twenties, they released *Kill 'Em All*, *Ride the Lightning,* *Master of Puppets*, and *...And Justice For All*, regarded as seminal metal records today.

Millennial babies grew up in the aftermath of Metallica's rise: rather than from underground clubs and snail mail tape trades, they discovered Metallica through MTV, rock radio, their older siblings' disc collections, video games like Guitar Hero. They were being born as Metallica's most recognized records were being put out.

The most underrepresented generation on the Blacklist is my own, and that of Metallica's children---Generation Z. I suppose that makes sense: born between 1997 and 2012, half of my generation had not yet come of age when the Blacklist was released in 2021. But Metallica won over Generation Z the following year, when Eddie Munson shredded *Master of Puppets* on the hit Netflix show *Stranger Things.*

# Conclusion

*The Metallica Blacklist* met mixed reviews. The consensus was that no one, regardless of age, would have known them all: one Redditor claimed to have only heard of Miley Cyrus; another claimed to recognize half and half. Most could recognize just a handful. Whether that handful consists of Ghost, Volbeat, and Royal Blood, or St. Vincent, Rina Sawayama, and Phoebe Bridgers, depends entirely on who you are and what your non-Metallica music taste is.

The novelty of the *Blacklist* is that most listeners will find both a familiar face and a new artist to get into.

This 

there is something on *The Metallica Blacklist* for everybody.
