I was eighteen when *The Metallica Blacklist* graced my Spotify home page. It was Metallica's first release since I started getting into their music, and although I wouldn't become fully obsessed with the band for another year, I enjoyed them enough to give it a listen. I couldn't sit through the entire record---my patience wore thin after six "Enter Sandman"s---but I did have my favorites: Rina Sawayama's "Enter Sandman," Cage The Elephant's "The Unforgiven," St. Vincent's "Sad But True." I felt *seen* by these covers, as if Metallica themselves had written me an invitation to their fanbase: open arms for the fans branded posers for the simple crime of being a teenage girl. 

In 2021, Metallica released *The Metallica Blacklist* commemorating the thirtieth anniversary of their eponymous fifth album. *Metallica* (1991) featured hits that pitched heavy metal into the mainstream, such as "Enter Sandman," "Sad But True," and "Nothing Else Matters."

# New Blood Joins This Earth
In 1991, with an average age of twenty-seven, the boys of Metallica were surprised to see parents and middle-agers among their headbanging audience. But come to a show now and this age range is the norm. Metallica themselves were born between 1962 and 1964, making them just barely Boomers. Like many musicians, they were a few years older than their audience---their earliest fans, who Lars Ulrich referred to as "the kids," were primarily Generation X.

The Blacklist, however, is heavy with Millennials. These musicians would have been born after Metallica started their career, the cutoff for their generation being the exact year Metallica was formed. In 2022, Eddie Munson shredded *Master of Puppets* on the Netflix show *Stranger Things,* making Metallica a hit with my own generation (and that of Metallica's kids)---Gen Z.
