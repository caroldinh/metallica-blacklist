### **What is your story about?*** (Elevator Pitch)
In 2021, Metallica released *The Metallica Blacklist* in collaboration with 53 other artists, each covering a song in their 1991 eponymous album. My story is an investigation of the genres, generations, countries, and artists represented in *The Metallica Blacklist* 
### Can you summarize in one sentence the single point you’re making?
*The Metallica Blacklist* represents Metallica's influence across genre, generation, and geography, and the diversity of their audience forty years into their career.
### Why is it exciting to you?
*The Metallica Blacklist* came out when I was 18, so naturally my favorite covers were those by St. Vincent, Rina Sawayama, and Cage the Elephant. Reading other peoples' thoughts on the compilation online, I realized almost everyone had a different favorite---some preferred the genre-defying pop covers, some preferred the rock and metal covers that were faithful to the original. 

### Why do _you_ want to tell this story? 
I'm a Generation Z Metallica fan. Although I knew their greatest hits before, I really started getting into their discography (and metal in general) around the same time Eddie Munson shredded "Master of Puppets" in *Stranger Things.* I never watched Season 4, but watching Metallica embrace new fans my age in response to gatekeeping from older fans gave me great respect for them. As a fan who is also a Vietnamese American young woman, I'm interested in subverting expectations of what a metalhead should "look like." The Bay Area thrash scene that Metallica came from was very culturally and ethnically diverse; the stereotype of metalheads as long-haired white guys was imposed on the genre later.
