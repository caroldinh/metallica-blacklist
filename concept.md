### **What is your story about?*** (Elevator Pitch)
Open Mind For A Different View" is an investigation of the genres, generations, countries, and artists represented in *The Metallica Blacklist*, a compilation of Metallica covers released by the band in collaboration with three artists to commemorate thirty years of the Black Album. 
### Can you summarize in one sentence the single point you’re making?
Metallica's influence transcends genre, generation, and geography, as demonstrated by the diversity of their audience and of *The Metallica Blacklist* forty years into their career.
### Why is it exciting to you?
*The Metallica Blacklist* came out when I was 18, so naturally my favorite covers were those by St. Vincent, Rina Sawayama, and Cage the Elephant. Reading other peoples' thoughts on the compilation online, I realized almost everyone had a different favorite---some preferred the genre-defying pop covers, some preferred the rock and metal covers that were faithful to the original. 

### Why do _you_ want to tell this story? 
I'm a Generation Z Metallica fan. Although I knew their greatest hits before, I really started getting into their discography (and metal in general) around the same time Eddie Munson shredded "Master of Puppets" in *Stranger Things.* I never watched Season 4, but watching Metallica embrace new fans my age in response to gatekeeping from older fans gave me great respect for them. As a fan who is also a Vietnamese American young woman, I'm interested in subverting expectations of what a metalhead should "look like." The Bay Area thrash scene that Metallica came from was very culturally and ethnically diverse; the stereotype of metalheads as long-haired white guys was imposed on the genre later.

### What makes this essay a **_visual_** essay?
This essay is an audiovisual essay that will include interactive charts, playable snippets of songs, and interview footage where Metallica has discussed the demographics of their audience.
### Conservatively, how long do you think this project will take?  
I can probably work on it 5-10 hours per week... maybe 2-3 months?
