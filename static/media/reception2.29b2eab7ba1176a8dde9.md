Some aspects that were criticized in some covers were praised in others: White Reaper receives kudos for their loyalty to “Sad But True,” but Weezer gets a universal eyeroll for their cookie-cutter “Enter Sandman.” Unsurprisingly, Miley Cyrus's *Nothing Else Matters* receives more attention than the rest, thanks to its high-profile byline. 

But I was disappointed that one of my favorite songs, Imelda May's "The God that Failed," went unnoticed by popular outlets; and that Diet Cig receieved mostly upturned noses despite being the only artist to have contributed their proceeds to mutual aid rather than charity, a.k.a. my kind of people!

So which is the best cover? I'll let you decide for yourself.
